# Concepts

GotLoop is a collaborative sound looper — a web and mobile application that allows users to share short looping sound samples, and to comment and like on them.

The first drafts of the app came from wanting to share Jamman loops, then from exploring the [WebAudio W3C API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio).

## Features

- Upload sound samples, directly from your mobile phone or looping pedal.
- Edit them, specify start and end point to make a perfect loop.
- Share loops on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Soundcloud).
- Follow other loop makers on the site.
- Assemble sound samples in songs to publish elsewhere.
